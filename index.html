      <h1>Core Beliefs</h1>
      <p>Salvation is a gift of grace, given through faith in the Most High. To enter the Kingdom of God, one
       must be born again—a spiritual rebirth, not a physical one, that transforms the heart and mind. This
       new life is found in surrender to His love, allowing the Spirit to guide us. Through repentance and
       faith, we turn away from our old ways and step into a life of purpose, peace, and true fulfillment as
       we are changed by His grace.
        <br><br>
        We believe that true faith requires taking responsibility for our lives, embracing gratitude each day,
        and acknowledging even the smallest blessings—food, water, a safe place to rest, family, friends,
        work, and the unique purpose we are called to fulfill. Living with such gratitude draws us closer to the
        Most High, and each day begins with a simple "thank you" for the gift of life and for the guidance of
        His Spirit.
        <br><br>
        To understand God fully, we turn to the Scriptures in their original form, studying the oldest texts and
       learning Hebrew to seek clarity and authenticity. This devotion to His Word grounds us, providing
       wisdom and light on our journey. We are careful about our physical health as well, choosing foods
       that nourish us—water rich with essential minerals, healthy foods, and an active lifestyle that
       strengthens us for the path ahead.
       <br><br>
       In this journey of faith, we stay focused on discovering our purpose and understanding the meaning
       of our lives. We look at our lives from all perspectives—recognizing where we’ve come from, where
       we are, and where we’re headed. As we grow, we ask ourselves: Are we surrounded by the right
       people? Are we building work and home environments that reflect peace, health, and spiritual
       strength? If we find that changes are needed, we make them with love and respect for the life we are
       given. We commit to living in a way that honors our purpose and draws us closer to the Most High,
       as we embrace the new life He has set before us.
